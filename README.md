# 42cursus-ft_containers

## Objectives
In this project, you will implement the various container types of the C++ standard
template library.
For each container, turn in the appropriately named class files.
The namespace will always be ft and your containers will be tested using ft::<container>.
You need to respect the structure of the reference container. If it’s missing a part of the
orthodox canonical form, do not implement it.
As a reminder, we are coding in C++98, so any new feature of the containers MUST NOT
be implemented, but every old feature (even deprecated) is expected.
